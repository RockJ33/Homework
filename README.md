# Rocky Chamberland

####  Hey everyone, my name is Rocky and I am originally from northern Maine. I spent the last 11 years serving in the United States Marine Corps and just moved to Saint Louis, Missouri with my family. I have a beautful wife named Hannah and three sons, Rocky, Archer and Cooper. The last 7 years of my military career I was in the Marine Special Operations Command. Apart from being a special operator I held collateral duties on the team to include a technicical skills operator (TSO) and joint terminal attack controller (JTAC). It was during this time I got introduced to the world of technology. I would build and maintain networks overseas for my special operations team and account for all our communication and information technology systems. This is were my interested started and I decided to transition out of the military and pursue a bachelors of science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I am always looking to advance my skills and thats when I found out about SavvyCoders and decided to take the Data Analytics and Python course.

Goals for the Data Analytics Course:
1. Understand Python, Git/GitHub.
2. Have the ability to clean large data sets and create accurate visual depictions utilizing different software. 
3. Build a network of like minded individuals. 
4. Create a marketable resume, LinkedIn profile, etc that will lead to future employmnet.

    I would have put a picture of my family because they are ultimatley what motivate and isnpire to complete this cohort. Everything I do is to try to give them a better life. Instead I decided to find something that I would like to provide for them and that I would enjoy. For me that would be a piece of land that we could have a couple horses and a mini farm. Teach them how to live off the land and self sustain. I think that the life skills I can teach them growing up there would be invaluable. Completing this course, advancing my studies and gaining meaningful employemnt will get me closer to this goal.
